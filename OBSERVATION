about mapsplice2
1. information of sam file for chimeric read is not reliable... (e.g., pair information, samflags and so on)
2. there are surely inconsistencies about the position and direction of paired reads of chimeric reads, 
so we can filter the chimeric read with inconsistent paired reads
3. also, it seems that there are surely inconsistencies about the position of break point and soft clipped position,
so we can also filter the chimeric reads with inconsistent break points.
